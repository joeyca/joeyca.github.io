            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>TutorNow is a mobile application for the Human Computer Interaction Programming Studio course at UC San Diego that my team and I developed. This course focused on developing a geographical and map-related application that addresses a need in the community and implements an intuitive design.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>In our needfinding process, we decided to focus on the students taking computer science courses. One of the problems they face in these courses was tutoring, although there are tutors designated for each course, there are not enough tutors to help every student. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Role</h2>
            <p>I created wireframes and surveyed students in CSE classes and also helped develop some of the user interfaces. </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Discovery</h2>
                <p>Students in computer science courses were struggling to receive help on their programming assignments even with designated tutors. If a student were to put themselves on the queue at the beginning of tutoring hours, the tutor would often not get to them by the time tutoring hours ended. This left a lot of students frustrated and discouraged. However, from our survey, students rarely paid for tutoring in computer science courses.</p>
                <p>In order to make up for the lack of resources available to students, we decided to create an application that provides real time tutoring to supplement the tutoring hours provided for each class. We would hope this would alleviate some of the frustration students were feeling when they were left on the queue. We presented this prototype to students in computer science and to our surprise, over 90% of the students would use this application to get help on their programming assignments and would also want to see group tutoring available since they assumed the cost would be cheaper.</p>
                <p>Our initial assumption that students would want the same type of one on one tutoring was wrong. Students would prefer group tutoring since it would be cheaper. Although cost would affect their decision for tutoring, they would be willing to pay a little more if their deadline was approaching.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading">The Deliverables</h2>
                <p>Our discoveries showed us that students would pay for tutoring services and would like the option of having group tutoring. Driven by our findings, we created an application that provides real time tutoring, similar to Uber, where students could request a tutor and if the demand was high, there would be a surge price.</p>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/portfolio/mapRoute.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">The tutor would accept accept the request and see a route to reach the student. Once the tutor reaches the student, the tutor will start the tutoring session.</span>

            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Once the tutoring session ends, the student can rate and leave a review their tutor when paying.</span>

           <h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>
            <p>To optimize TutorNow, we would implement the option of group tutoring, surge pricing for peak demand, and being able to ask a question for a fee based on the feedback we received from tutors and students.</p>
