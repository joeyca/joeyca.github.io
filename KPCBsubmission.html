            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Tiny Houses are homes that are less than 1,000 square feet. These tiny houses first emerged in the wake of natural disasters to help families who have lost their homes, but now the purpose of tiny houses have evolved. Tiny houses allow individuals the ability to own houses since they are much more affordable. My siblings and I thought it would be fun to live in one for a few days, so we booked a 500 square feet tiny house through Airbnb.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Surviving two days in a tiny house with my siblings.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Role</h2>
            <p>Carrying out my daily routine in the tiny house.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Discovery</h2>
            <p>At first, the concept of tiny house did not sound appealing to me. But to my surprise, I loved my experience. The bathroom was a little cramped but I had enough room for my skin routine and apply makeup. However, making meals in the kitchen was a little tougher. I had to utilize the dining table in order to have enough counter space. When it was time for bed, the 'bedroom' served its purpose of being a space to rest so I could not sit up and use my laptop without hitting my head. It felt like the college dorm room triple with the loft beds. The storage spaces were cleverly thought out: the window bench served as storage, the table was one you could fold down from the wall, and the walls were lined with cubbies and shelves. The 500 square foot house felt more useful than my house that was three times the size. Almost every inch served a purpose. That is a struggle that I often find myself with when designing an interface for a web, tablet, and mobile application. I found this tiny house inspiring. The space was crafted with lots of uses but a drawback was comfort. The close proximity made my siblings and I closer as we had to coordinate moving across different areas of the house. I liked how the space was easier to maintain. There was less to clean and really helped me narrow down what belongings were important to me. My siblings and I ate more meals together due to limited space. This house made me rethink of what I needed in life, a house serves as a shelter and the tiny house provided exactly that. It was quite refreshing and I enjoyed how minimalistic my life felt for those two days because I realized I had everything I needed already.
           <h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>
            <p>I found that the tiny house encouraged me to spend more time outside, instead of laying in my bed longer to scroll through my phone, because of how cramped the 'bedroom' felt. This leaves room for a redesign/evolution of tiny houses to integrate storage into everyday useful household necessities and to find a way to create an atmosphere that feels open.</p>
