                                <p><a href="http://bucketwithfriends.herokuapp.com">Bucket</a> is an application to create and track bucket lists collaboratively, letting you work on your own or with your friends and family. Recreating the concept of the traditional bucket list. This application was created with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, React, mongoDB, and Yelp API in a team of three students.</p>

                                <p>This is the original paper prototype we created which featured a chat room with a sidebar displaying friends and a navigation bar with activities and their popularity. Our prototype slowly shifted as we found that content in chats often get lost and messy over time. We migrated to a card system with Trello in mind. </p>

                                The user is initially logged into their own personal bucket list, which contains tags they can create and personalize. They can add activities using the Yelp API integrated search to each tag created. The user can also create groups with their friends, where the group can create tags and add activities to each tag seamlessly.

                                Some obstacles we faced were confusion between creating buckets and creating groups because users would often confuse them. We conducted AB testing using Google Analytics, where we had one test with the name 'Bucket' and another test with the name 'Tag' to see which one was more intuitive. The test with the name 'Tag' had more tags created so we concluded that version with 'Tag' was most straightforward.</p>
                                
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Bucket7.png" alt="">
                                <p>When logged in, each group's navigation bar has 'Add Friends,' 'Groups', and 'Settings.' Based on user feedback, there was a lot of confusion between groups and tags, so I chose to have 'Groups' on the navigation bar to reflect the group the user is currently in instead. This not only reduces confusion but this design choice provides the user more feedback.</p>

                                <p>FINAL PRODUCT: Our <a href="http://bucketwithfriends.herokuapp.com"> application</a> was inspired by the designs of Trello and the idea of a traditional bucket list. In the future, we hope to improve these aspects of the application: Refine Help Modal - to highlight the areas of the application to accomodate the 'Getting Started' tips. Filter/Sorting for Yelp search results - to provide quality search results. Dropdown suggestions for Search - to help users conveniently search. Adding activities across groups - to allow users to add cards to their own personal bucket if they found an activity in a group they wanted to do on their own.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Music Application Redesign using Invision and Adobe Illustrator for Usability and Information Architecture, Fall 2016</p>
                                <p>Our <a href="https://invis.io/359KO6CVC#/209450301_Home">redesign</a> was inspired by the designs of Facebook, Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, and YouTube Music because we valued consistency and user intuition. As an individual who listens to music daily and uses a few music applications, I find it hard to have one application that's not overwhelming with features. Our goal was to create a music application largely influenced by Facebook. Why Facebook? We felt a music application maintaining familiarity would be more intuitive.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/MusApp.png" alt="">
                                <p>For the home page, we chose to display 'Recently Played' first with photos based on our needfinding. Users liked Spotify's “Jump Back In” feature because they were able to continue where they left off. We did, however; improve Spotify's concept of "Jump Back In" by adding two rows to reduce the amount of times the user would have to swipe right to go to where they left off. For the rest of the application pages, the scroll up and down and swipe up features were integrated across all the modals. This design choice was to stay consistent with already existing interaction methods on many popular applications. For the home page, we wanted to keep it simple because users reported that Spotify was very overwhelming at times; our simplification lets the user listen to music conveniently without excessively swiping right or scrolling.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/MusApp2.png" alt="">
                                <p>The screen for each playlist is largely influenced by Spotify's and SoundCloud’s playlist screens. Like Spotify and SoundCloud, we used the three dots “more options” icon to encompass adding, deleting, sharing, and viewing/following the artist. Two features that set our playlist page apart from the two applications mentioned above is one, the icon located next to the current song playing. Two, our “More by Creator” label is visible above the fold to provide users easy discoverability and quick access to other related playlists. Users will benefit from the ease of discovering new music without having to switch over to the “Discover” section in Spotify. I brought back the search and navigation bar on the top of the screen because we wanted to give the user flexibility to go back and forth on most used screens/functions.</p>

The user can browse songs through the index and search bar, add and delete songs using the + and - icons to the left of the song, and create a playlist by selecting a song.</p>

                                <h2>Traffic in Chicago</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Analzying and modeling data using MatLab for Modeling and Data Analysis, Fall 2016</p>
                             
                                <p>Looking at a traffic dataset in Chicago, my team and I (four students) wanted to determine at what times and areas traffic was most dense. To answer our questions, we used linear regresson and k-means to identify problem areas.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/DataVis3.png" alt="">
                                <p>K-Means Clustering: We chose K-means clustering because we felt grouping by geographic location is necessary to find congestion densities because where answers our question of where traffic is most dense. Since the potential groups are not labeled, this would be an unsupervised question. Figure 1 shows our findings from k-means algorithm, the dots represent the midpoints of the starting and end points (color is associated to the Xs they belong to) and the Xs represent the intersections of most congestions. Figure 2 shows the starting and end colored points where blue is no data, red is slow, yellow is medium, and green is fast. We integrated google maps onto our figure by superimposing the dots.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/DataVis2.png" alt="">
                                <p>Linear Regression: We chose regression because we had over a million data points and felt 70/30 cross validation and regression would best predict the speed based on the time of day. Since the question I am answering is a supervised learning problem, I know the output is a continous valued data, speed. On the x-axis is the time in hours in decimals and on the y-axis is the speed in mph. Figure 3 has dots that represent the speed of a segment and the zero values are true zeros where traffic is at a stop. At 9am and 6pm, the graph concaves because there is slower traffic in those areas. From our 6th order model, I have concluded 9 AM has the most traffic.On the x-axis is the time in hours (in decimals) and on the y-axis is speed (in mph). Through K-means clustering, I am able to analyze which areas had the most traffic density so we can find “less dense” areas to divert traffic to. Through regression, I am able to analyze patterns of traffic density in order to find the times of day with greater needs of public transportation. From our regression model, the 6th model is the best since it had the smallest test set sum squared error, making the 6th model the best traffic congestion predictor. </p>
                                <p>FINAL PRODUCT: From this, I learned that regression was not the best way to determine what times had the highest traffic density due to the any variables. Therefore in the future, I hope to use multivariable linear regression to identify and weed out outliers as it greatly affected our regression model. Our data analysis and modeling was featured in a poster for our final presentation for our course.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tri2JW.png" alt="">
                                <p>My first draft of my final logo incorporates my initials J and W through fragmentation of the all encompassing triangle. The initial logo is inspired by the concept of a mosaic to reflect the many experiences that have shaped me into the individual I am today.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/triJW.png" alt="">
                                <p>My final logo encompasses aspects of my character - the J and W representing my name, the mountains the W makes to reflect my hobby of hiking, and the triangle (bearing resemblance to a mountain) encasing my initials to signify my love of exploration.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/cirJW.png" alt="">
                                <p>My second logo design draws inspiration from living in close proximity to La Jolla beaches and from attemping to learn how to surf. My first initial is the wave coming in with the second initial as the rigid waves following. A circle encloses my initials because I feel most comfortable in a pool since I teach swimming to children and adults as a swim instructor.</p>

                                <p>This is a variation in my second logo design. I added lines to highlight my initials because I felt it was hard to differentiate my initials in the first design of my second logo.</p>

                                <p>Looking at the additional needs not met by the EnVision Maker Studio, my team and I (5 students) found what resources students needed to supplement the EnVision Maker Studio to optimize the use of Room 306. As the team lead for my team, I organized and lea team meetings as well as updated the Director weekly on the team's progress. </p>
</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Room306.png" alt="">
                                <p>From our user interviews, students wanted a place to curate their ideas and collaborate with others, to spark their creativity, and to draw inspiration for their upcoming projects.</p>

                                <p>We drew inspiration from Design Lab and Digital Media Lab on campus and the San Diego Public Library MakerSpace for our collaborative space. We came up with many versions of the room layout and discussed them with the Director. The Director brought our ideas to the Jacobs School of Eningeering. From this experience, I found out how challenging it was design a collaborative space from scratch. After needfinding, the challenge was finding ways to spark creativity and arrange the room in way that would encourage collaboration without physically testing our ideas.</p>
 </p>
                                <p>FINAL PRODUCT: At the end of our internship, our team finished our vision for the room. Room 306 will be a thinking hub that serves as an extension of the EnVision MakerStudio, promoting one of the first creative commons at UC San Diego. This space is open to all engineering and visual arts students and instills the values of these two communities. Room 306 invites students of diverse skillsets to collaborate: featuring a Wall of Innovation to showcase their masterpieces, a Lego Wall to spark ingenuity, and a whiteboard wall to provide a foundation to build and share your ideas. We hope this space embodies the idea of a drawing board, where students can modify, re-create, and recycle ideas. The “by students, for students” mentality wishes to inspire a culture of cooperation. Room 306 is expected to open at the end of Winter Quarter 2017.</p>

                                <p>The EnVision Maker Studio, an arts and engineering studio, is the first hands-on creative space where students in engineering and visual arts can collaborate on innovative designs at University of California, San Diego.

                                <p>Our design opportunity was to provide an approachable and safe environment for students to make the most out of the resources available in the studio. Since the studio opened in January 2016, we anticipated that most users would be new to the space and noticed that new users faced more problems in comparison to experienced users; so our target audience was first-time users of the studio. Through our needfinding process, we narrowed down our opportunity to familiarizing users to the Envision Maker Studio’s physical space and procedures. Our goal was to help users easily identify the locations of different workstations and tools and to facilitate some of the most important procedures required in the studio, such as signing in when they enter the space and putting on safety goggles in caution areas.</p>

We had signs for our rapid prototyping to see how efficiency and familiarity improved through observations throughout the week. Little improvements were shown and we found many students missing our dull signs so we opted for more colorful signs and a new method to test our prototypes. Our main method of evaluating the efficacy of our second iteration was through a scavenger hunt which we asked users to complete a list of steps that took them around the studio.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Signs.png" alt="">
                                <p>Additionally, we created a floor plan using Adobe Illustrator(laminated and printed) of the space next to the sign-in station. These act as portable maps that students can reference at their workstations to familiarize themselves with the studio while working on projects. This is meant to help supplement the large signs we have implemented for each station in the studio. The signs are large and brightly colored in order to grab students’ attention and clearly label the space in a way that contrasts the bare, white walls. In our improved scavenger hunt, we tested our studio maps, and found that though our map was straightforward, it limited users’ ability to navigate on their own because they were fixated on the map.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/SignInKiosk.png" alt="">
                                <p>Our data also informed us that many first-time users had no idea where to ask for help in the studio. Therefore, we created a  TA/Staff schedule next to the sign-in station to inform students who to ask for assistance. Our prototype testing indicated that users are now aware of where to look for a TA for help. We decided to place all these resources at the sign-in station so upon entrance, students are immediately able to use the space in an effective way.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ToolCart.png" alt="">
                                <p>Lastly, we implemented photos of tools on each of the tool carts in order to clearly indicate where students should return specific tools. This design solution addresses the problem of students not knowing where to return tools and subsequently ending up with disporportionate tools on each of the tool carts. The silhouettes are made of pictures that we took of each tool; they are printed to scale in order to make the process of returning tools efficient and visually intuitive.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/EnVision.png" alt="">
                                <p>FINAL PRODUCT: Throughout this process, we learned how certain layouts and design choices would make the <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/envision/index.sfe">EnVision Maker Studio</a> more approachable. From the data we collected from our final prototypes, we found that there is still much to improve on. In the future, we hope to improve on the following: caution tape/safety goggles sign, user’s experience of transporting tools, and the names of the stations. </p>
