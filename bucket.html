            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bucket is a responsive web application for the Interaction Design course at UC San Diego that my team and I developed. Bucket is an application to create and track bucket lists collaboratively, letting you work on your own or with your friends and family. Recreating the concept of the traditional bucket list. This course focused on developing a collaborative application that addresses a need in the community and implements an intuitive design.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>In our needfinding process, we decided to tackle on the struggle of the students trying to make plans when hanging out for our collaborative application. Friends would often use Facebook messenger or group messaging to suggest possible hang out ideas, which can be overwhelming and confusing if you jumped in an hour later with over 50 messages. How do we make an application that is able to seamlessly organize everyone's input? </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Role</h2>
            <p>I created the paper prototypes and user testing script, in addition to user testing and contributing to the development. </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Discovery</h2>
                <p>From our user interviews, we found many students in group messages would not go back to read the previous messages and just read the last five or so until, they were caught up with what was being currently talked about. So a lot of previous suggestions were lost.</p>
            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/portfolio/Bucket5.png" alt="">
            </a>
                <p>We started off with this first prototype that featured a chat room with a sidebar displaying friends and a navigation bar with activities and their popularity. However, after initial testing, this prototype was still not solving the issue of lost content in group messaging. We changed our prototype to activity cards with Trello as our inspiration. With our second prototype, the user is initially logged into their own personal bucket list, which contains tags they can personalize. The user can add activities using the Yelp API integrated search to each tag created. Additionally, the user can also create groups with their friends, where the group can create tags and add activities to each tag seamlessly.</p>
                <a href="#">
                  <img class="img-fluid" src="img/portfolio/Bucket6.png" alt="">
                </a>
                <p>Our initial assumption of our prototype being intuitive was wrong. Some obstacles we faced were confusion between creating buckets and creating groups because when logged in, each group's navigation bar has 'Add Friends,' 'Groups', and 'Settings.' Based on user feedback, there was a lot of confusion between groups and tags, so we chose to have 'Groups' on the navigation bar to reflect the group the user is currently in instead. This not only reduces confusion but this design choice provides the user more feedback. Initially, 'tags' were named 'buckets' but from our AB testing, the test with the name 'Tag' had more tags created so we concluded that version with 'Tag' was most straightforward. User surveys indicated that users thought buckets were groups, instead of the list we were intending it to be. To reduce the confusion, first time users saw a popup help modal that would teach them how to create a tag and group. Our user testing showed this popup modal helped our users significantly and allowed them to navigate around the application more efficiently.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The Deliverables</h2>
                <p>Our discoveries made our original idea pivot to a bucket list concept. Our final product is a web application that allows users to collaboratively make and complete bucket lists with friends. The application was created with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, React, mongoDB, and Yelp API.</p>
            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/portfolio/Bucket3.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Users can search for and add activities and places to their individual and collaborative bucket lists.</span>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/portfolio/Bucket7.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">From our user testing, we found it was important to show the user which bucket list they were in and a easy way to jump between groups on the drop down menu.</span>

           <h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>
            <p>We hope to improve these aspects of the application: Refine Help Modal - to highlight the areas of the application to accomodate the 'Getting Started' tips. Filter/Sorting for Yelp search results - to provide quality search results. Dropdown suggestions for Search - to help users conveniently search. Adding activities across groups - to allow users to add cards to their own personal bucket if they found an activity in a group they wanted to do on their own.</p>
