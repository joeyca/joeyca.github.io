            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>GOING is a prototype web application for the IxD StartUp Studio course at UC San Diego that my team and I developed. This course focused on addressing a need in our community and proposing a solution. The team had to create a value proposition that was financially viable and technically feasible. We were required to implement business plan and a crowdfunding campaign. At the end of the quarter, we participated in a competition to see how many investors (Intel Product Managers and Designers) would be on board and our idea placed 3rd among 15 other teams.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>In our needfinding process, we discovered one of the most important needs of a college student was to save money while still being able to indulge from time to time. From this, we surveyed 20 college students about an activity they enjoyed but do not do often due to cost. We found that movies was one of the top three and after doing research, so we decided to pursue movies. Our goal is let college students experience the movies again at an affordable cost.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Role</h2>
            <p>I led the needfinding and user research process and contributed to the development of our prototype idea as well as marketing.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Discovery</h2>
            <p>The community of focus was college students and we identified that many college students would rather wait for the movie to come out on streaming platform than pay to watch it in theaters. Movies in the La Jolla and San Diego area on average was $17 ticket. After surveying 30 students, we found that on average students would pay $10 for a movie ticket. College students would go to the movies more if the cost was lower.</p>
            <p>For the movie theaters, we identified that many theaters were empty during the weekdays and on the weekends, most of the movies were only half full and only full upon the first week of release. To our surprise, movie theaters run on the profit from concessions, not movie tickets.</p>
            <p>Our initial assumption that movie theaters profited off movie tickets was wrong. Our new problem was figuring out how to drive concession sales, so we asked the same individuals we interviewed earlier, We asked the same individuals, how much money they would spend on concessions if the ticket was full price and if the movie ticket was $7. If the movie ticket was full price, more than 75% of the responses said they would sneak food in. However, if the movie ticket was $7, they would spend on average $10 since movie ticket was only $7. College students were more willing to buy concessions if the movie ticket cost was lower.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Deliverables</h2>
            <p>Our discoveries gave us new insight and we needed to find a value proposition that would address the business needs of the movie theaters and the financial needs of the college students. Driven by our findings, we created a platform for getting seats back into the theaters with a price unlock feature and commit feature, where theaters can offer discounts at each ticket sale goal met when a movie is not projected to sell well and to let consumers only purchase a ticket if it reaches a certain ticket sale goal.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Users receive confirmation that they have committed to buy a ticket once it reaches a desired goal.</span>

           <h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>
            <p>To optimize the prototype, we would add friend referral and frequent purchase incentives to drive more traffic on the web application. Another feature would include adding a movie calendar on the landing page to engage immediate interest of college students.</p>

            <p>Our final web application prototype,
              <a href="https://invis.io/THC32369E">Going</a> and our
              <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/40500694/310550872?token=322e0f95">crowdfunding campaign</a> was a favorite among the Intel product managers and designers and was in the top three startup ideas to be invested in.</p>
