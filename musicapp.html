            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Our prototype is a redesign of current music applications for the Usability and Information Architecture course at UC San Diego that my team and I developed.This course focuses on identifying and solving usability problems and one of our projects was to create a music application.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>In our needfinding process, we found the user interfaces of Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple Music, and Youtube Music varied in consistency and user intuition. Our user interviews sound that many users found themselves trying to locate a certain feature on each music application because the features did not always have an intuitive icon or location. Our goal was to create a music application that was intuitive.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Role</h2>
            <p>I created the paper prototypes of the music application redesign and led the user research. </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Discovery</h2>
                <p>From our user interviews, many college students wanted a music application that was easy to use and was already familiar to them. Using this piece of information, we surveyed the social media platforms college students used most and not surprisingly, it was Facebook. We evaluated the mobile application of Facebook and had their design as inspiration as we developed ours. However, we still looked to other music applications to ensure we were still covering all the music application components.</p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">The Deliverables</h2>
              <p>Our prototype was largely influenced by Spotify and Facebook because those were the two applications most used based on our needfeeding results. The top of the screen features a search bar and a navigation bar with four icons. The user can browse songs through the index and search bar, add and delete songs using the + and - icons to the left of the song, and create a playlist by selecting a song.Our final product is a redesign of music applications as of Fall 2016 and was created with Adobe Illustrator and InVision.</p>

           <h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>
            <p>In the future, we hope to change our album cover photos to a rounded edge as the squares come off as too harsh. Most importantly, we would have the navigation bar at the bottom instead of the top, so it is easier for users to reach.</p>
